<Note title="Good to know about built-in" type="info">
  Everyone has access to built-in functions. This is useful to curate functins from GPTs or LLMs, introducing new variants of coding methodology.

## Setting up API Key at Ingra

### [API Key]({CONST.HUBS_APIKEY_SETUP_URL}) Setup

In order for GPTs to invoke your function from anywhere, it's important to keep it secured.

For example, OpenAI Custom ChatGPT requires this. You can read more about this at [ChatGPT Setup with Ingra](/docs/getting-started/quick-start-guide/chatgpt-setup)

## Setting up Environment Variables and OAuth Integrations at Ingra

Ingra hosts your functions that you own or subscribed to in a form of API which can be accessed by LLMs.


### [Environment Variables]({CONST.HUBS_APP_URL}{CONST.APP_SETTINGS_ENV_VARS_URI}) Setup

Functions are mostly curated with environment variables to complete a task.

Ingra provides a way for your functions to communicate to third-parties. Therefore, you can store these keys at [Environment Variables]({CONST.HUBS_APP_URL}{CONST.APP_SETTINGS_ENV_VARS_URI}) which Ingra will pass them as `arguments` to said functions.

### [OAuth Integrations]({CONST.HUBS_APP_URL}{CONST.APP_SETTINGS_INTEGRATIONS_URI}) Setup
