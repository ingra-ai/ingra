  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Visit Hubs Marketplace">
    ### View community curated collections or functions.

    [Hubs Marketplace]({CONST.HUBS_MARKETPLACE_URL}) is community driven, developers may host their own public functions or collections by curating their own and opt-in to make it `Public`.

    <Note title="Good to know" type="note">
      - To invoke the functions that you curated or subscribed to, LLMs require your [OpenAPI]({CONST.HUBS_OPENAPI_URL}). Therefore you need to [Sign-in]({CONST.APP_AUTH_LOGIN_URL}) with your email.
    </Note>

    {CONST.APP_NAME} automatically creates an API endpoint for those functions, and provides your [OpenAPI]({CONST.HUBS_OPENAPI_URL}) that you can just paste into GPTs / LLMs.
