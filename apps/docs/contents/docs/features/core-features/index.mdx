## Function Marketplace

The Ingra Marketplace is a community-driven space where developers can explore, share, and customize functions. It provides an opportunity for collaboration in AI tool creation and automation. Discover more functions and collections in the [Hubs Marketplace]({CONST.HUBS_MARKETPLACE_URL}). Here, developers can host their own public functions or collections and make them available for others to use.

### Your Own Functions Hub

The central repository for discovering, curating, and managing custom functions. With Ingra, LLMs can call and create functions dynamically, supporting advanced use cases and diverse workflows.

## OpenAPI and Swagger Specs

Ingra provides auto-generated OpenAPI and Swagger specifications for every function curated on the platform. This ensures that functions are well-documented and easy to integrate with various external services. You can view the complete OpenAPI specification [here]({CONST.HUBS_OPENAPI_URL}) and access the Swagger interface [here]({CONST.HUBS_SWAGGER_URL}).

## Virtual Machine Execution

Functions run in a secure, isolated VM environment, providing a controlled execution space for safe operations.

## Privacy Controls

Ingra offers granular privacy settings to manage data access and interactions with AI. Users can limit data access for specific functions and control data sharing.

## ChatGPT Plugin Integration

Interact with functions using natural language commands through the ChatGPT plugin, leveraging the FaaS capabilities of Ingra for a conversational AI experience.
