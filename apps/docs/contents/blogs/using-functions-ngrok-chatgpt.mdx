## Introduction: The Future of Coding with Voice and LLMs

Imagine being able to perform complex software engineering tasks with nothing more than your voice. By harnessing the power of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Ingra functions, and ngrok, you can turn this vision into reality. In this blog post, we explore how you can use voice prompts through ChatGPT to control your local machine, showcasing how this very MDX file was created using remote shell execution and function calling.

## Utilizing Ingra and ChatGPT to Control Your Home Computer

This setup enables remote shell command execution on your local machine using ngrok, Ingra functions, and ChatGPT function calling capabilities. Hereâ€™s how it all works:

- **Ngrok Setup**: Using `ngrok`, we expose a local Flask server (`./local-scripts/flask_server.py`) to the internet, enabling secure remote access.
- **Ingra Functions**: The `executeRemoteShellCommand` function is curated on the Ingra platform, allowing remote execution of shell commands.
- **ChatGPT Function Calling**: ChatGPT triggers these shell commands to perform actions such as creating utility scripts, committing changes to GitHub, and more.

## Example Workflow: Creating This Blog Post

In this session, I set up `ngrok` on my local computer to point to `./local-scripts/flask_server.py`. By configuring the `LOCAL_NGROK_URL` and `LOCAL_NGROK_BEARER` environment variables in Ingra, we enable secure communication.

### Example Usage
With this setup, I utilized ChatGPT function calling to:

- **Curate `executeRemoteShellCommand` in Ingra**: This function allows for the execution of remote shell commands.
- **Trigger Shell Commands via ChatGPT**: Commands such as creating the `local-scripts` utility for the Ingra GitHub repository.
- **Automate Git Commands**: Trigger `git commit` and `git push` through simple prompts.

Hereâ€™s a sample chat session that covered these actions:

## Step-by-Step Guide: From Prompt to Execution

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment
Before diving into the commands, letâ€™s set up the environment:

1. **Ngrok**: Ensure `ngrok` is installed on your local machine to expose a local server securely.
2. **Ingra Functions**: Set up Ingra functions to execute Node.js functions remotely and securely.
3. **ChatGPT**: Use ChatGPTâ€™s function calling to trigger shell commands that control your local machine.

### Step 2: Understanding the Components
#### 1. Ngrok
Ngrok creates a secure tunnel to your localhost, allowing for remote shell command execution on your local machine.

#### 2. Ingra Functions
Ingra provides the `executeRemoteShellCommand` function, which allows you to execute shell commands on a remote server exposed via ngrok.

### Step 3: Executing Remote Commands
With this setup, commands like the following are executed remotely through ChatGPT prompts:
```bash
// Command to list files in the blog directory
executeRemoteShellCommand({ command: ls ./apps/docs/contents/blogs/ });

// Command to read content for the blog
executeRemoteShellCommand({ command: cat ./local-scripts/README.md });

// Command to create this MDX file
executeRemoteShellCommand({ command: "echo MDX content here > ./apps/docs/contents/blogs/new-blog.mdx" });
```

### Step 4: Automating with ChatGPT
By leveraging ChatGPT, you automate the execution of these commands, generate content, and manage files on your local machineâ€”all through simple voice or text prompts.

## Conclusion: The Future is Voice and Automation

By combining the power of Ingra functions, ngrok, and ChatGPT, weâ€™ve demonstrated how to generate this blog post and manage your local machine without manually writing a single line of code. This approach not only simplifies software engineering tasks but also makes them accessible to everyone, regardless of technical background.

Welcome to the future of software engineering, where complex workflows are just a conversation away. ðŸš€
