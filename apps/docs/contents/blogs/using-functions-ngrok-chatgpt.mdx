## Introduction: The Future of Coding with Voice and LLMs

Imagine performing complex software engineering tasks effortlessly with just your voice. By harnessing the power of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, {CONST.APP_NAME} functions, and ngrok, you can turn this vision into reality. In this blog post, we explore how you can use voice prompts through ChatGPT to control your local machine, showcasing how this very MDX file was created using remote shell execution and function calling.

## Utilizing {CONST.APP_NAME} and ChatGPT to Control Your Local Machine

Leverage the power of Ngrok, {CONST.APP_NAME} functions, and ChatGPT to execute remote shell commands on your local machine seamlessly. Hereâ€™s how it all works:

- **Ngrok Setup**: Using [ngrok]((https://ngrok.com/download)), we expose a local Flask server (`./local-scripts/flask_server.py`) to the internet, enabling secure remote access.
- **{CONST.APP_NAME} Functions**: The `executeRemoteShellCommand` function is curated on the {CONST.APP_NAME} platform, allowing remote execution of shell commands.
- **ChatGPT Function Calling**: ChatGPT triggers these shell commands to perform actions such as creating utility scripts, committing changes to GitHub, and more.

## Step by step Guide

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Run Flask Server in your local machine">
    You can view our own [flask_server.py]({CONST.APP_GITHUB_URL}/blob/main/local-scripts/flask_server.py), or you can just copy and paste it to run it in your local.

    ```sh
    python3 ./flask_server.py
    ```

    Once you run it, remember the `PORT` where Flask server is running on. In my case, it's `5000`

    <Note title="Bearer Token" type="info">
      {CONST.APP_NAME}'s [flask_server.py]({CONST.APP_GITHUB_URL}/blob/main/local-scripts/flask_server.py) require a bearer token which will be used at later stage.
    </Note>

  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Run Ngrok in your local machine">
    Setting up ngrok is simple and free, follow their guide [at their page](https://ngrok.com/download)

    Run Ngrok by specifying the Flask server `PORT` for secure access. In my case, it's `5000`

    ```sh
    ngrok http 5000
    ```

    Once **ngrok** has started, it will provide you a public URL such as `https://11a0-255-55-55-200.ngrok-free.app`.
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Saving to {CONST.APP_NAME} Environment Variables">
    Create new environment variables at {CONST.APP_NAME};

    | Name | Value |
    | ---- | ---- |
    | `LOCAL_NGROK_URL` | https://11a0-255-55-55-200.ngrok-free.app |
    | `LOCAL_NGROK_BEARER` | Your-Bearer-Token-from-Step1 |

    #### Via Web
    
    You can add it at your [Environment Variables at {CONST.APP_NAME}]({CONST.HUBS_SETTINGS_ENVVARS_URL})

    #### Via GPT (ChatGPT)

    To setup ChatGPT with {CONST.APP_NAME}, you can follow our guide here [Setting up {CONST.APP_NAME} for Custom ChatGPT](/docs/getting-started/quick-start-guide/chatgpt-setup)

    And you can simply prompt the GPT with;

    ```sh
      Create new environment variables:
      - LOCAL_NGROK_URL: https://11a0-255-55-55-200.ngrok-free.app
      - LOCAL_NGROK_BEARER: Your-Bearer-Token-from-Step1
    ```
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Create the function at {CONST.APP_NAME}">
    You have 3 options:
    - Visit and clone this [executeRemoteShellCommand function](https://hubs.ingra.ai/repo/bakabit/functions/view/578caac0-1f9e-4c44-bf37-4560a15fa395) 
    - Subscribe to function above, or the collection that contains it.
    - Curate your own function, use above as reference.

    <Note title="Test the function" type="note">
      Once you have the function, visit your [Swagger]({CONST.HUBS_SWAGGER_URL}) to find the function and test it on the web.
    </Note>
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Invoke the function from GPT">
    Once the function is set up, directly invoke it from ChatGPT by simply searching for the function. Since you already have [Built-in function](/docs/features/builtin-functions)

    Example Prompt:
    ```sh
      Search for a function for ngrok
    ```
    ```sh
      Search for a function named executeRemoteShellCommand
    ```
    etc..

    <Note title="Updating OpenAPI" type="note">
      Optionally, after you own the function - you can visit your [OpenAPI]({CONST.HUBS_OPENAPI_URL}) and update to your own Custom ChatGPT.

      Read more about that at [Setting up {CONST.APP_NAME} for Custom ChatGPT](/docs/getting-started/quick-start-guide/chatgpt-setup)

  <StepperItem title="That's it!">
    You should now be able to run your home computer remotely, via ChatGPT.

    <Note title="A Fun Note" type="success">
      Try prompting it with voice command with mobile ChatGPT application.

### Understanding the Components
#### 1. Ngrok
Ngrok creates a secure tunnel to your `localhost`, allowing for remote shell command execution on your local machine.

#### 2. {CONST.APP_NAME} Functions
{CONST.APP_NAME} provides the `executeRemoteShellCommand` function, which allows you to execute shell commands on a remote server exposed via ngrok.

### Executing Remote Commands
With this setup, commands like the following are executed remotely through ChatGPT prompts:
```bash
// Command to list files in the blog directory
executeRemoteShellCommand({ command: ls ./apps/docs/contents/blogs/ });

// Command to read content for the blog
executeRemoteShellCommand({ command: cat ./local-scripts/README.md });

// Command to create this MDX file
executeRemoteShellCommand({ command: "echo MDX content here > ./apps/docs/contents/blogs/new-blog.mdx" });
```

### Automating with ChatGPT
By leveraging ChatGPT, you automate the execution of these commands, generate content, and manage files on your local machineâ€”all through simple voice or text prompts.

### Example Workflow: Creating This Blog Post

In this session, I set up `ngrok` on my local computer to point to `./local-scripts/flask_server.py`. By configuring the `LOCAL_NGROK_URL` and `LOCAL_NGROK_BEARER` environment variables in {CONST.APP_NAME}, we enable secure communication.

#### Example Usage
With this setup, I utilized ChatGPT function calling to:

- **Curate `executeRemoteShellCommand` in {CONST.APP_NAME}**: This function allows for the execution of remote shell commands.
- **Trigger Shell Commands via ChatGPT**: Commands such as creating the `local-scripts` utility for the {CONST.APP_NAME} GitHub repository.
- **Automate Git Commands**: Trigger `git commit` and `git push` through simple prompts.

Hereâ€™s a sample chat session that covered these actions:
