# Bakabit Portal

Bakabit Portal is designed to help you curate and manage functions or workflows that can be used to create your own personal assistant suite tailored to your needs.
Our goal is to make these functions freely available for everyone, enabling a community-driven approach to personal assistant development.

It's available to review at [https://portal.bakabit.com](https://portal.bakabit.com) with your browser to see the result.

#### Getting Started as a new User
1. Login and visit [Marketplace](https://portal.bakabit.com/functions/marketplace) and find some useful community-functions for you to Subscribe or Fork.
2. Visit [Overview](https://portal.bakabit.com/overview), Review the notification alert and you may find links to your **openapi.json** for your GPT actions or **Swagger** to test it on the web.
3. Generate API key at [https://portal.bakabit.com/settings/api](https://portal.bakabit.com/settings/api) for `x-api-key` header when configuring your ChatGPT actions
4. Paste JSON from **openapi.json** to your own chatgpt plugins actions.
5. Interact with your personalized GPT hooked with the functions you have.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 18 or later)
- pnpm, npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL database

#### Prerequisites, but will be made optional
- (optional) AWS SES Key - to send authentication email for signing in
- (optional) Google OAuth - Some functions require Google access token to run
- (optional) [Vercel KV](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv) - For faster auth session interactions

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chozzz/bakabit-portal.git
   cd bakabit-portal
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   # or, if you're using npm
   npm install
   # or, if you're using yarn
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up your environment variables:**

   Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env.local` and fill in your database connection details and any other environment variables required.


## Environment Variables

The Bakabit Portal utilizes several environment variables for its configuration. You will need to set these up in your `.env.local` file. Here's a guide to the required environment variables:

### Database Setup with Prisma

To understand how to play around with Prisma, view the [Prisma readme](https://github.com/chozzz/bakabit-portal/tree/main/prisma)

1. Configure your database connection:

   Ensure your `.env.local` file includes the database connection string for your PostgreSQL database:

   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase?schema=public"
   ```

2. Run Prisma migrations:

   To set up your database schema or apply any updates, run the Prisma migration command:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

   This command creates the tables in your database according to the schema defined in **prisma/schema.prisma**.

3. Generate Prisma client:

   Generate the Prisma client to interact with your database:

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

## Authentication

We're just using [Magic Link AUTH](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-vancouver/assets/presentations/2020-08_The_Evolution_of_Authentication.pdf) to authenticate user.

Therefore, the following configuration is needed

#### JWT Configuration Setup

To securely manage user sessions and authentication, Bakabit Portal utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT). You must generate a secure JWT secret for your application:

- `JWT_SECRET`: A secret key used for signing JWT tokens. Ensure this is a long, random string to maintain security.

You can use OpenSSL to generate a secure secret:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 48
```

#### Setup AWS SES Configuration

These variables are required for integrating Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) for sending emails:

- `AWS_SES_REGION`: The AWS region where your SES instance is located, e.g., `us-east-1`.
- `AWS_SES_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS access key ID for SES.
- `AWS_SES_SECRET`: Your AWS secret access key for SES.
- `AWS_SES_MAIL_FROM`: The email address used as the sender in emails sent from the portal. This email must be verified with Amazon SES.

For more detailed instructions and additional configurations, refer to the [Amazon SES Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/).
